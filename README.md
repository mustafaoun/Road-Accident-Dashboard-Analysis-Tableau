# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Analysis-Tableau
**University of California, Davis â€“ Data Visualization Specialization (Capstone Project)**  
**Tool:** Tableau

## Project Overview

This project aims to **transform raw road accident data into actionable insights** through an interactive Tableau dashboard.  
The goal was simple yet impactful: **turn thousands of accident records into a story that informs strategy and prevention.**

By applying the principles of *data storytelling, audience-first design,* and *visual hierarchy*, I built a dashboard that allows decision-makers to quickly identify **key causes, trends, and hotspots** behind road accidents.

## Objectives

- Simplify complex accident data for non-technical users.  
- Identify leading causes of accidents (e.g., distracted driving, speeding, mechanical failure).  
- Highlight trends over time and across regions.  
- Support policymakers and analysts with data-driven prevention insights.
